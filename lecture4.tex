\chapter{Tensor product. Structure of finite K-algebras}
This is a digression on commutative algebra. We introduce and study
the notion of tensor product of modules over a ring. We prove a
structure theorem for finite algebras over a field (a version of the
well-known "Chinese remainder theorem").


\section{Definition of tensor product}

\subsection{Summary for previous lectures}
We considered finite \nameref{def:fextension1} $L$ i.e
$\left[L:K\right] < \infty$. We also saw that if
$L$ is generated by a finite number of \nameref{def:degsepelem}s 
$\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_r$ then the number of
\nameref{def:homomorphism}s over $K$ from $L$ to $\bar{K}$ denoted by
$\left|Hom_K\left(L, \bar{K}\right)\right|$ is equal to
$\left[L:K\right]$. In general
\[
\left[L:K\right]_{sep} = 
\left|Hom_K\left(L, \bar{K}\right)\right| \le
\left[L:K\right].
\]

For $L = K\left(\alpha\right)$ it is clear because the number of
homomorphisms is equal to the number of roots of the
\nameref{def:minpolynomial} $P_{min}\left(\alpha, K\right)$. In
general one can use induction and multiplicativity of the degree
$\left[L:K\right]$ and number of homomorphisms (see theorem
\nameref{thm:lec3_3}). Thus  separable extension was exactly an
extension  which had the right number of homomorphisms into the
algebraic closure.

Our next goal is to characterize the separability in the terms of
tensor product.

\subsection{Tensor product}

\begin{definition}[Tensor product]
  Let $A$ is a ring, $N$, $M$ are $A$-\nameref{def:module}s. The
  tensor product $M \otimes_A N$
  is another $A$-\nameref{def:module} together with an
  $A$-bilinear map $\phi: M \times N \to M \otimes_A N$ which has
  ``\nameref{def:universalproperty}'' defined below
  \label{def:tensorproduct}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Universal property]
  $A$-bilinear map $\phi: M \times N \to M \otimes_A N$ has
  ``universal property'' if
  $\forall P$ - $A$-\nameref{def:module} and
  for $A$-bilinear $f: M \times N \to P$ (
  i.e.
  \(
  \forall m, f_m:
  \begin{array}{c}
    N \to P \\
    n \to f(m,n)
    \end{array}
  \)
  and
  \(
  \forall n, f_n:
  \begin{array}{c}
    M \to P \\
    m \to f(m,n)
    \end{array}
  \)
  are \nameref{def:homomorphism}s of $A$-modules
  ), then
  $\exists! \tilde{f}$ - homomorphism of $A$-modules such that
  $f = \tilde{f} \circ \phi$
  \footnote{
    That means that the diagram commutes
  }

  \begin{tikzpicture}[description/.style={fill=white,inner sep=2pt}]
    \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes, row sep=3em,
      column sep=2.5em, text height=1.5ex, text depth=0.25ex]
            { M \times N & & P \\
              & M \otimes_A N & \\ };
            %\draw[double,double distance=5pt] (m-1-1) – (m-1-3);
            \path[->]
            (m-1-1) edge node[auto] {$ f $} (m-1-3)
            edge node[auto] {$ \phi $} (m-2-2)
            (m-2-2) edge node[auto] {$ \tilde{f} $} (m-1-3);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \label{def:universalproperty}
\end{definition}

The property characterize the pair
$\left(\phi, M \otimes N\right)$.
Really if have another pair
$\left(\overline{\phi}, \overline{M \otimes N}\right)$
like this one then by definition we have mutually inverse
homomorphisms of $A$-modules between them

\begin{lemma}[About uniqueness of object defined by universal
    property]
  \footnote{
    It is out of the lecture video and can be considered as an
    explanation for the claim about having mutually inverse
    homomorphisms of $A$-modules
  }
  If we have two objects $\left(\phi, M \otimes N\right)$
  and $\left(\overline{\phi},\overline{M \otimes N}\right)$
  which both satisfies \nameref{def:universalproperty} than there is
  an unique \nameref{def:isomorphism} between them: 
  \[
  \left(\phi, M \otimes N\right) \cong \left(\overline{\phi},
  \overline{M \otimes N}\right)
  \]
\begin{proof}
Let $P = \overline{M \otimes N}$ and $f =
\overline{\phi}$. In 
the case we can consider the following diagram

\begin{tikzpicture}[description/.style={fill=white,inner sep=2pt}]
  \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes, row sep=3em,
    column sep=2.5em, text height=1.5ex, text depth=0.25ex]
          { & & M \otimes_A N & \\
            M \times N & & \overline{M \otimes_A N} \\
            & & M \otimes_A N & \\ };
          %\draw[double,double distance=5pt] (m-1-1) – (m-1-3);
          \path[->]
          (m-2-1) edge node[auto] {$ \phi $} (m-1-3)
          (m-1-3) edge node[auto] {$ g = \tilde{\overline{\phi}} $} (m-2-3)
          (m-2-1) edge node[auto] {$ \overline{\phi} $} (m-2-3)
          (m-2-1) edge node[auto] {$ \phi $} (m-3-3)
          (m-2-3) edge node[auto] {$ \bar{g} = \tilde{\phi} $} (m-3-3);
\end{tikzpicture}

Thus we have that there are 2 homomorphisms
$g :  M \otimes_A N \to \overline{ M \otimes_A N}$
and
$\bar{g} :  \overline{M \otimes_A N} \to M \otimes_A N$ moreover
$g \circ \bar{g} = id_{M \otimes_A N}$
\footnote{
  We have that both $g$ and $\bar{g}$ are linear. They also declared
  to be unique. They combination is also linear and ??? unique. The
  $id_{M \otimes_A N}$ satisfies the linear property and from
  uniqueness there is no any others
}
i.e. $\bar{g} = g^{-1}$ i.e. we have an
\nameref{def:isomorphism} and the isomorphism is unique as soon as the
function $g$ is unique due the \nameref{def:universalproperty}.

We just prove an isomorphism existence between
$M \otimes N$ and $\overline{M \otimes N}$ but the tensor product is
characterized not only by the module $M \otimes N$
but also a bilinear map $\phi$ for that we can have the following:
setting $P = \overline{M \otimes N}$ we
can get that $\bar{\phi} = \tilde{\bar{\phi}} \circ \phi$ is
determined by the unique
relation $\phi \to \bar{\phi}$ as soon as
$\tilde{\bar{\phi}}$ is unique. Analogues one can get unique relation
$\bar{\phi} \to \phi$.
\end{proof}
\label{lem:universalpropertyuniqueness}
\end{lemma}

The uniqueness does not mean existence and we should proof that such
object exists.
\begin{lemma}[About tensor product existence]
  Tensor product defined via \nameref{def:universalproperty} exists
  \begin{proof}
    Lets consider $\mathcal{E}$ the maps (functions) from
    $M \times N$ to $A$ as sets which are $0$ almost everywhere
    (i.e. outside of a finite set). For example we can consider delta
    functions:
    \[
    \delta_{m,n} : M \times N \to A
    \]
    such that
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \delta_{m,n}(m,n) = 1,
      \nonumber \\
      \delta_{m,n}(m',n') = 0 \mbox{ if } (m,n) \ne (m',n')
      \nonumber 
    \end{eqnarray}
    Then $\mathcal{E}$ is a A-\nameref{def:freemodule} with basis
    $\delta_{m,n}$. Thus we have a map of sets $M \times N \to
    \mathcal{E}$ such that $(m,n) \to \delta_{m,n}$ which is not bilinear
    but we can make it bilinear by means of changing $\mathcal{E}$.
    
    Let $\mathcal{F} \subset \mathcal{E}$ a submodule generated by
    $\delta_{m+m',n} - \delta_{m,n} - \delta_{m',n}$,
    $\delta_{m,n+n'} - \delta_{m,n} - \delta_{m,n'}$,
    $\delta_{am,n} - a\delta_{m,n}$,
    $\delta_{m,an} - a\delta_{m,n}$.
    \footnote{
      The basis is chosen to be a bilinear $\mod \mathcal{F}$, for instance
      $\delta_{m+m',n} = \delta_{m,n} + \delta_{m',n} \mod \mathcal{F}$
    }
    
    It can be shown that $M \times N \to \mathcal{E}/\mathcal{F}$ is
    bilinear
    \footnote{
      Follows from the basis choice
    }
    and has the desired \nameref{def:universalproperty}.

    Really lets we have the following bilinear map:
    $f: M \times N \to P$. Then we can consider the following map
    $f': \mathcal{E} \to P$ that sends $\delta_{m,n}$ to
    $f(n,m)$. Using the fact that $f$ is bilinear we can get
    \begin{eqnarray}
      f'(\delta_{m+m',n}) = f'(\delta_{m,n}) + f'(\delta_{m',n}),
      \nonumber \\
      f'(\delta_{m,n+n'}) = f'(\delta_{m,n}) + f'(\delta_{m,n'}),
      \nonumber \\
      f'(\delta_{am,n}) =  a f'(\delta_{m,n}),
      \nonumber \\
      f'(\delta_{m,an}) = a f'(\delta_{m,n})
      \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}
    with the $f'$ linearity we have
    \begin{eqnarray}
      f'(\delta_{m+m',n}) = f'(\delta_{m,n} + \delta_{m',n}),
      \nonumber \\
      f'(\delta_{m,n+n'}) = f'(\delta_{m,n} + \delta_{m,n'}),
      \nonumber \\
      f'(\delta_{am,n}) =  a f'(\delta_{m,n}),
      \nonumber \\
      f'(\delta_{m,an}) = a f'(\delta_{m,n})
      \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}

    The kernel $\ker f' = \mathcal{F}$ thus if we want to have a
    homomorphism to $P$ we have to replace $\mathcal{E}$ with
    $\mathcal{E}/\mathcal{F}$. In the case we will replace $f'$ with
    $\tilde{f}\left(\delta_{m,n} \mod \mathcal{F}\right) = f(m,n)$. As
    soon as the images for the basis is fixed the mapping is unique.
  \end{proof}
