\chapter{Finite fields. Separability, perfect fields}
We recall the construction and basic properties of finite fields. We
prove that the multiplicative group of a finite field is cyclic, and
that the automorphism group of a finite field is cyclic generated by
the Frobenius map. We introduce the notions of separable (resp. purely
inseparable) elements, extensions, degree. We briefly discuss perfect
fields.
