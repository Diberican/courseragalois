\chapter{Solvability by radicals, Abel's theorem. A few words on
  relation to representations and topology}

We finally arrive to the source of Galois theory, the question which
motivated Galois himself: which equation are solvable by radicals and
which are not? We explain Galois' result: an equation is solvable by
radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable in the sense of
group theory. In particular we see that the "general" equation of
degree at least 5 is not solvable by radicals. We briefly discuss the
relations to representation theory and to topological coverings.
