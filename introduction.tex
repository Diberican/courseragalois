\chapter*{Introduction}

The document keeps lecture notes on Introduction to Galois theory that
was provided by Ekaterina Amerik (Higher School of Economics) via
Coursera.

Each chapter corresponds to one lecture (or one week on Coursera). The
appendix keeps useful info for the course that is absent in it
i.e. requirements that are necessary for the course understanding.
