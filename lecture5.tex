\chapter{Structure of finite K-algebras continued}

We apply the discussion from the last lecture to the case of field
extensions. We show that the separable extensions remain reduced after
a base change: the inseparability is responsible for eventual
nilpotents. As our next subject, we introduce normal and Galois
extensions and prove Artin's theorem on invariants.
