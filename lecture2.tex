\chapter{Stem field, splitting field, algebraic closure}
We introduce the notion of a stem field and a splitting field (of a
polynomial). Using Zorn's lemma, we construct the algebraic closure of
a field and deduce its unicity (up to an isomorphism) from the theorem
on extension of homomorphisms.

\section{Stem field. Some irreducibility criteria}

\subsection{Stem field}

\begin{definition}[Stem field]
Let $P \in K\left[X\right]$ is an irreducible
\nameref{def:monicpolynomial}. \nameref{def:fextension1} E is a stem
field of $P$ if $\exists \alpha \in E$ - the root of polynomial
$P$ and $E = K\left[\alpha\right]$.
\label{def:stemfield}
\end{definition}

Such things exist, for instance we can take
$K\left[X\right]/\left(P\right)$. It is a field because $P$ is
irreducible moreover the root of the $P$ is in the field (see example
\ref{ex:F2overP}).

We also can say that for any stem field $E$:
\[
K\left[X\right]/\left(P\right) \cong E.
\]
We can use the following \nameref{def:isomorphism}:
$f: \forall p \in K\left[X\right]/\left(P\right) \rightarrow
p(\alpha)$, there $\alpha$ is a root of polynomial $P$.
To summarize we have the following
\begin{proposition}[About stem field existence]
  The stem field exist and if we have 2 stem fields $E$ and $E'$ which
  correspond 2 roots of $P$: $E = K\left[\alpha\right]$,
  $E' = K\left[\alpha'\right]$ then $\exists! f: E \cong E'$
  (\nameref{def:isomorphism} of K-algebras) such that $f(\alpha) =
  \alpha'$. 
  \begin{proof}
    Existence: $K\left[X\right]/\left(P\right)$ can be took as the
    stem field.

    Uniquest of the \nameref{def:isomorphism} is easy because it is
    defined by it's value on argument $\alpha$:
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \phi: K\left[X\right]/\left(P\right) \cong_{x \to \alpha} E,
      \nonumber \\
      \psi: K\left[X\right]/\left(P\right) \cong_{x \to \alpha'} E',
      \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}
    thus
    \[
    \phi^{-1} \circ \psi: E \cong_{\alpha \to \alpha'} E'.
    \]
  \end{proof}
  \label{prop:stemfield}
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}[About stem field]
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item In particular: If a stem field contains 2 roots of $P$ then
    $\exists!$ \nameref{def:automorphism} taking one root into
    another.
  \item If $E$ stem field then $\left[E:K\right] = deg P$
  \item If $\left[E:K\right] = deg P$ and $E$ contains a root of $P$
    then $E$ is a stem field
  \item If $E$ is not a stem field but contains root of $P$ then
    $\left[E:K\right] > deg P$ (???)
  \end{enumerate}
  \label{rem:lec2_1}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Some irreducibility criteria}

\begin{corollary}
  $P \in K\left[X\right]$ is irreducible over $K$ if and only if it
  does not have a root in \nameref{def:fextension1} $L$ of $K$ of such that
  $\left[L:K\right] \le \frac{n}{2}$, where $n = deg P$.
  \label{cor:lec2_1}
  \begin{proof}
    $\Rightarrow$: If $P$ is not irreducible then it has a polynomial $Q$ that
    divides $P$ and $deg Q \le \frac{n}{2}$ ($P = RQ$ and if
    $deg Q > \frac{n}{2}$ then we can take $R$ as $Q$). The
    \nameref{def:stemfield} $L$ for $Q$ exists and it's degree is $deg Q
    \le \frac{n}{2}$. $L$ should have root of $Q$ (as soon as root of
    $P$) by definition.

    $\Leftarrow$: If $P$ has a root $\alpha$ in $L$ then $\exists
    P_{min}\left(\alpha, K\right)$ with degree
    $\le \frac{n}{2} < n$ (because $\left[L:K\right] \le \frac{n}{2}$)
    that divides $P$ i.e. $P$ become reducible.
  \end{proof}
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
  $P \in K\left[X\right]$ irreducible with $deg P = n$. Let $L$ be an
  extension of $K$ such that $\left[L:K\right] = m$.
  If $gcd\left(n,m\right) = 1$ then $P$ is irreducible over $L$.
  \label{cor:lec2_2}
  \begin{proof}
    If it is not a case and $\exists Q$ such that $Q \mid P$ in
    $L\left[X\right]$. Let $M$ be a \nameref{def:stemfield} of $Q$
    over $L$.

    So we have $K \subset L \subset M = L\left(\alpha\right)$. $M$ is
    a stem field that $\left[M:L\right] = deg Q = d < n$. Thus
    $\left[M:L\right] = m d$

    Lets $K\left(\alpha\right)$ is a stem field of $P$ over $K$ then
    $\left[K\left(\alpha\right):K\right] = deg P = n$.

    $K\left(\alpha\right) \subseteq M$ and therefore $n \mid md$ thus
    using $gcd(m,n)=1$ one can get that $n \mid d$ but this is
    impossible because $d < n$.
  \end{proof}
\end{corollary}


\section{Splitting field}

\begin{definition}[Splitting field]
  Let $P \in K\left[X\right]$.
  The splitting field of $P$ over $K$ is an extension $L$ where $P$ is
  split (i.e. is a product of linear factors) and roots of $P$
  generate $L$
  \label{def:splittingfield}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[About splitting fields]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Splitting field $L$ exists and $\left[L:K\right] \le d!$,
      where $d = deg P$.
    \item If $L$ and $M$ are 2 splitting fields then
      $\exists \phi: L \cong M$ (an \nameref{def:isomorphism}). But
      the \nameref{def:isomorphism} is not necessary to be unique.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{proof}
    Lets prove by induction on $d$. The first case ($d = 1$) is
    trivial the $K$ itself is the splitting field. Now assume $d > 1$
    and that the theorem is valid for any polynomial of degree $< d$
    over any field $K$. Let $Q$ be any irreducible factor of $P$. We
    can create a \nameref{def:stemfield} $L_1 = K\left(\alpha\right)$
    for $Q$ that will be also a \nameref{def:stemfield} for $P$.

    Over $L_1$ we have $P = (x - \alpha) R$, where $R$ is a polynomial
    with $deg R = d - 1$. We know (see remark \ref{rem:lec2_1}) that
    there exists a \nameref{def:splittingfield} $L$ for $R$ over $L_1$
    and its degree:
    \(
    \left[L:L_1\right] \le (d-1)!
    \)
    We have $K \subset L_1 \subset L$. The $L$ will be a splitting
    field for original polynomial $P$. Its degree (by
    \nameref{thm:mulformuladegrees}) is $ \le d \cdot (d-1)! = d!$.

    Uniqueness: Let $L$ and $M$ are 2 splitting fields. Let $\beta$ is
    a root of $Q$ (irreducible factor of $P$) in $M$.
    We have 2 stem fields: $L_1 = K\left(\alpha\right)$ and
    $M_1 = K\left(\beta\right)$. Proposition \ref{prop:stemfield} says
    as that
    \[
    \exists \phi: L_1 = K\left(\alpha\right) \cong
    K\left(\beta\right) = M_1, 
    \]
    such that $\phi(\alpha) = \beta$.

    Over $M_1$ we have $P = (x - \beta) S$, where
    $S = \phi\left(R\right)$
    \footnote{
      We have $\phi: K\left(\alpha\right) \to
      K\left(\beta\right)$. The $\phi: K \to K$ because
      $K \subset K\left(\alpha\right)$ as well as
      $K \subset K\left(\beta\right)$. Therefore
      $\phi\left(P\right) = P$ because $P \in K\left[X\right]$.
      Thus
      \[
      P = (x - \beta) S = \phi\left(P\right) =
      \phi\left((x - \alpha) R\right) =
      (x - \beta) \phi\left(R\right)
      \]
      and $S = \phi\left(R\right)$.
    }

    $M$ is splitting field for $S$ over
    $K\left(\beta\right) = M_1$. $M$ is also $L_1$-algebra (via the
    \nameref{def:isomorphism} $\phi$) and as such it's a splitting
    field for $R$ over $L_1$. By induction (???) we have an
    $L_1 = K\left(\alpha\right)$ \nameref{def:isomorphism} $L \cong M$
    and we have $K$ \nameref{def:isomorphism} $L \cong M$.    
  \end{proof}
  \label{thm:lec2_1}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
  The \nameref{def:isomorphism} is not unique. A splitting field  can
  have many \nameref{def:automorphism} and this is in fact the subject
  of Galois theory.
\end{remark}
