\chapter{Galois correspondence and first examples. Examples continued}
We continue to study the examples: cyclotomic extensions (roots of
unity), cyclic extensions (Kummer and Artin-Schreier extensions). We
introduce the notion of the composite extension and make remarks on
its Galois group (when it is Galois), in the case when the composed
extensions are in some sense independent and one or both of them is
Galois. The notion of independence is also given a precise sense
("linearly disjoint extensions").


\section{Cyclotomic extensions (cont'd). Examples over $\mathbb{Q}$}

Last time we discussed cyclotomic extensions which are splitting
fields of $\Phi_n$ (generated by n-th roots
(\nameref{def:primitiverootsofunity}) of 1). And we got a very precise
description of those extensions in the case when $Phi_n$ was
irreducible, for instance, over $\mathbb{Q}$.

We have seen (see theorem \ref{thm:lec6_3}) that
$\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_n\right)$ is a \nameref{def:galoisextension} of
\nameref{def:galoisgroup} $\left(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$
(see example \ref{ex:multiplicativegroup}) 
where $\zeta_n = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{n}}$. So it acts as $g_a: \zeta_n \to
\zeta_n^a$ where $a \in \left(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$
that can be considered as a number relatively prime to $n$: $\left(a,
n\right) = 1$.

Lets consider several examples

\begin{example}[$n=8$]
  Lets consider $n = 8$. In the case
  \[
  \left|\left(\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times\right| = 4
  \]
  i.e. the group has 4 elements there are
  \[
  \left(\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times =
  \left\{
  1,3,5,7
  \right\}.
  \]
  So our Galois group also has 4 elements:
  \[
  Gal: \left\{
  id, \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^3,
  \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^5, \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^7
  \right\} =
  \left\{
  id, \sigma_3, \sigma_5, \sigma_7
  \right\}.
  \]
  We can note that $\sigma_7 = \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^7$ is something
  very simple - it is complex conjugation:
  $\sigma_7 = \zeta_8 \to \bar{\zeta}_8$. It's
  \nameref{def:fixedfield} $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_7}$
  is determined by the following expression
  \footnote{
    ??? need a proof
  }
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_7} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right) \cap \mathbb{R} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 + \bar{\zeta}_8\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)
  \]
  i.e. there is a quadratic extension.

  Our Galois group has 3 subgroups of order 2 so we have 3 quadratic
  sub-extensions. One o them we have already found
  ($\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)$) lets find 2 others.
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_3} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 + \zeta_8^3\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(i \sqrt{2}\right).
  \]
  and finally (with note $\zeta_8^5 = - \zeta_8, \zeta_8^6 = -i$)
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_5} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 \cdot \zeta_8^5\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8^6\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(i\right).
  \]  
\end{example}

\begin{example}[$n=5$]
  $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right)$ where $\zeta_5 = e^{\frac{2 \pi
      i}{5}}$. The \nameref{def:galoisgroup} is the following:
  \[
  Gal \cong \left(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times
  \]
  that is a \nameref{def:cyclicgroup} of order 4. It is generated by
  $\zeta_5 \to \zeta_5^2$ and it has only one
  \nameref{def:propersubgroup} $\cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ so our
  field $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right)$
  has only one sub-field different from $\mathbb{Q}$ of course and
  this going to be a real part all of the complex conjugation which
  are part of Galois group. Now this is the same as the real part
  $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right) \cap \mathbb{R} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5 + \bar{\zeta}_5\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(cos \frac{2 \pi}{5}\right)$.
\end{example}
So these were the examples of cyclotomic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$
and of course the picture is exactly the same as long as the
cyclotomic polynomial is irreducible. If it is not reducible, which
can happen as we have seen, the Galois group becomes smaller.
