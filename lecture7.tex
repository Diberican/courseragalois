\chapter{Galois correspondence and first examples. Examples continued}
We continue to study the examples: cyclotomic extensions (roots of
unity), cyclic extensions (Kummer and Artin-Schreier extensions). We
introduce the notion of the composite extension and make remarks on
its Galois group (when it is Galois), in the case when the composed
extensions are in some sense independent and one or both of them is
Galois. The notion of independence is also given a precise sense
("linearly disjoint extensions").


\section{Cyclotomic extensions (cont'd). Examples over $\mathbb{Q}$}

Last time we discussed cyclotomic extensions which are splitting
fields of $\Phi_n$ (generated by n-th roots
(\nameref{def:primitiverootsofunity}) of 1). And we got a very precise
description of those extensions in the case when $Phi_n$ was
irreducible, for instance, over $\mathbb{Q}$.

We have seen (see theorem \ref{thm:lec6_3}) that
$\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_n\right)$ is a \nameref{def:galoisextension} of
\nameref{def:galoisgroup} $\left(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$
(see example \ref{ex:multiplicativegroup}) 
where $\zeta_n = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{n}}$. So it acts as $g_a: \zeta_n \to
\zeta_n^a$ where $a \in \left(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$
that can be considered as a number relatively prime to $n$: $\left(a,
n\right) = 1$.

Lets consider several examples

\begin{example}[$n=8$]
  Lets consider $n = 8$. In the case
  \[
  \left|\left(\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times\right| = 4
  \]
  i.e. the group has 4 elements there are
  \[
  \left(\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times =
  \left\{
  1,3,5,7
  \right\}.
  \]
  So our Galois group also has 4 elements:
  \[
  Gal: \left\{
  id, \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^3,
  \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^5, \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^7
  \right\} =
  \left\{
  id, \sigma_3, \sigma_5, \sigma_7
  \right\}.
  \]
  We can note that $\sigma_7 = \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^7$ is something
  very simple - it is complex conjugation:
  $\sigma_7 = \zeta_8 \to \bar{\zeta}_8$. It's
  \nameref{def:fixedfield} $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_7}$
  is determined by the following expression
  \footnote{
    ??? need a proof
  }
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_7} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right) \cap \mathbb{R} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 + \bar{\zeta}_8\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)
  \]
  i.e. there is a quadratic extension.

  Our Galois group has 3 subgroups of order 2 so we have 3 quadratic
  sub-extensions. One o them we have already found
  ($\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)$) lets find 2 others.
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_3} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 + \zeta_8^3\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(i \sqrt{2}\right).
  \]
  and finally (with note $\zeta_8^5 = - \zeta_8, \zeta_8^6 = -i$)
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_5} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 \cdot \zeta_8^5\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8^6\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(i\right).
  \]  
\end{example}

\begin{example}[$n=5$]
  $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right)$ where $\zeta_5 = e^{\frac{2 \pi
      i}{5}}$. The \nameref{def:galoisgroup} is the following:
  \[
  Gal \cong \left(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times
  \]
  that is a \nameref{def:cyclicgroup} of order 4. It is generated by
  $\zeta_5 \to \zeta_5^2$ and it has only one
  \nameref{def:propersubgroup} $\cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ so our
  field $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right)$
  has only one sub-field different from $\mathbb{Q}$ of course and
  this going to be a real part all of the complex conjugation which
  are part of Galois group. Now this is the same as the real part
  $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right) \cap \mathbb{R} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5 + \bar{\zeta}_5\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(cos \frac{2 \pi}{5}\right)$.
\end{example}
So these were the examples of cyclotomic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$
and of course the picture is exactly the same as long as the
cyclotomic polynomial is irreducible. If it is not reducible, which
can happen as we have seen, the Galois group becomes smaller.

\section{Kummer extensions}

Consider a field $K$ such that the characteristics of $K$ is prime to
a certain number $n$: $\left(char K, n\right) = 1$ and such that $X^n
- 1$ splits in $K$. So $K$ contains all roots of unity. Consider an
element $a$ of $K$ : $a \in K$ and let $\alpha = \sqrt[n]{a}$ (i.e. a
root of $X^n - a$). Take $d = \min{\left\{ i \mid \alpha^i \in
  K\right\}}$.

\begin{proposition}
  $d \mid n$, minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ is $X^d - \alpha^d$ and
  $K\left(\alpha\right)$ is a \nameref{def:galoisextension} with
  cyclic \nameref{def:galoisgroup} of order $d$.
  \begin{proof}
    It's clear that $K\left(\alpha\right)$ is Galois because all the
    n-th roots of unity are in $K$. So $K\left(\alpha\right)$
    contains all roots of $X^n - a$. Therefore $K\left(\alpha\right)$
    is a \nameref{def:splittingfield} of $X^n - a$. So it's normal and
    separable because it is a separable polynomial because $\left(char
    K, n\right) = 1$.

    Lets define a \nameref{def:homomorphism}
    $f: Gal\left(K\left(\alpha\right)/K\right) \xrightarrow[g \to
      \frac{g\left(\alpha\right)}{\alpha}]{} \mu_n$. This is correct
    because $g$ sends $\alpha$ to another root of $X^n - a$ thus the
    quotient $\frac{g\left(\alpha\right)}{\alpha}$ is a root of unity:
    \[
    \left(\frac{g\left(\alpha\right)}{\alpha}\right)^n = 1.
    \]
    The homomorphism $f$ is \nameref{def:injection} because
    $g\left(\alpha\right)$ determines $g$. What's the image? It should
    be a \nameref{def:subgroup} of a \nameref{def:cyclicgroup} $\mu_n$
    but the subgroup should be also cyclic.
    \footnote{
      ??? add a ref
    }
    Let $\delta$ is the order of the image and we want to show that
    $\delta = d$. Consider
    $g\left(\alpha^\delta\right) = f\left(g\right)^\delta \cdot
    \alpha^\delta = \alpha^\delta$ because $f\left(g\right)$ is a root
    of 1 ($f\left(g\right) = \sqrt[\delta]{1}$). Thus $\alpha^\delta
    \in K$. And $\alpha^i \notin K$ for $i < \delta$ since otherwise
    $\deg P_{min}\left(\alpha, K\right) = i < \delta$. But this is
    impossible because
    \[
    \left[K\left(\alpha\right):K\right] =
    \left|Gal\left(K\left(\alpha\right)/K\right)\right| = \delta.
    \]
    Thus only possible option is $d = \delta$. Thus
    $P_{min}\left(\alpha, K\right) = X^d - \alpha^d$.
  \end{proof}
  \label{prop:lec7_1}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  And conversely (to \ref{prop:lec7_1}) for all cyclic extension of
  degree $n$ such that $\left(char K, n\right) = 1$ is generated by
  $\sqrt[n]{a}$ for some $a \in K$.
  \begin{proof}
    Consider $L$ is an extension of $K$.
    $Gal\left(L/K\right) = \left<\sigma\right>$ then we have
    $\sigma^n = id$. We have that $\sigma$ is diagonalisable.
    \footnote{
      ??? add a ref to linear algebra theorem
    }
    Now, let us show that all eigenspaces have dimension 1. Indeed if
    $x,y$ are in the same eigenspace then
    $\sigma\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \frac{x}{y}$ because $x$ and $y$
    are multiplied by the same number. Therefore $\frac{x}{y} \in
    K$. And this is exactly means that dimension of the eigenspace is
    1.
    \footnote{
      ???
    }
    Thus all roots of 1 are eigenvalues of $\sigma$. Then take
    $\alpha$ such that $\sigma\left(\alpha\right) = \zeta \alpha$
    where $\zeta$ is a \nameref{def:primitiverootsofunity}. Then
    $\left<\sigma\right>$ - orbit of $\alpha$ has $n$ elements
    therefore $\left[K\left(\alpha\right):K\right] = n$ (see
    explanation below) and $\alpha^n
    \in K$ since $\sigma\left(\alpha^n\right) = \zeta^n \cdot \alpha^n
    = \alpha^n$. We see that $\alpha$ is a root of $X^n - a$. This is
    irreducible by degree reason.

    Maybe I should have said here, why it follows from the formula,
    $\left<\sigma\right>$ - orbit of $\alpha$ has $n$ elements
    that the degree of the extension is exactly $n$. While this is
    easy because either degree of the extension was less than $n$,
    then also, alpha would have to be fixed by some non-trivial
    subgroup of Galois group by Galois correspondence. And then its
    orbit would have less than $n$ elements.  
  \end{proof}
  \label{prop:lec7_2}
\end{proposition}
