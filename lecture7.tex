\chapter{Galois correspondence and first examples. Examples continued}
We continue to study the examples: cyclotomic extensions (roots of
unity), cyclic extensions (Kummer and Artin-Schreier extensions). We
introduce the notion of the composite extension and make remarks on
its Galois group (when it is Galois), in the case when the composed
extensions are in some sense independent and one or both of them is
Galois. The notion of independence is also given a precise sense
("linearly disjoint extensions").


\section{Cyclotomic extensions (cont'd). Examples over $\mathbb{Q}$}

Last time we discussed cyclotomic extensions which are splitting
fields of $\Phi_n$ (generated by n-th roots
(\nameref{def:primitiverootsofunity}) of 1). And we got a very precise
description of those extensions in the case when $Phi_n$ was
irreducible, for instance, over $\mathbb{Q}$.

We have seen (see theorem \ref{thm:lec6_3}) that
$\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_n\right)$ is a \nameref{def:galoisextension} of
\nameref{def:galoisgroup} $\left(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$
(see example \ref{ex:multiplicativegroup}) 
where $\zeta_n = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{n}}$. So it acts as $g_a: \zeta_n \to
\zeta_n^a$ where $a \in \left(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times$
that can be considered as a number relatively prime to $n$: $\left(a,
n\right) = 1$.

Lets consider several examples

\begin{example}[$n=8$]
  Lets consider $n = 8$. In the case
  \[
  \left|\left(\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times\right| = 4
  \]
  i.e. the group has 4 elements there are
  \[
  \left(\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times =
  \left\{
  1,3,5,7
  \right\}.
  \]
  So our Galois group also has 4 elements:
  \[
  Gal: \left\{
  id, \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^3,
  \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^5, \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^7
  \right\} =
  \left\{
  id, \sigma_3, \sigma_5, \sigma_7
  \right\}.
  \]
  We can note that $\sigma_7 = \zeta_8 \to \zeta_8^7$ is something
  very simple - it is complex conjugation:
  $\sigma_7 = \zeta_8 \to \bar{\zeta}_8$. It's
  \nameref{def:fixedfield} $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_7}$
  is determined by the following expression
  \footnote{
    ??? need a proof
  }
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_7} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right) \cap \mathbb{R} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 + \bar{\zeta}_8\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)
  \]
  i.e. there is a quadratic extension.

  Our Galois group has 3 subgroups of order 2 so we have 3 quadratic
  sub-extensions. One o them we have already found
  ($\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right)$) lets find 2 others.
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_3} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 + \zeta_8^3\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(i \sqrt{2}\right).
  \]
  and finally (with note $\zeta_8^5 = - \zeta_8, \zeta_8^6 = -i$)
  \[
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8\right)^{\sigma_5} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8 \cdot \zeta_8^5\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_8^6\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(i\right).
  \]  
\end{example}

\begin{example}[$n=5$]
  $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right)$ where $\zeta_5 = e^{\frac{2 \pi
      i}{5}}$. The \nameref{def:galoisgroup} is the following:
  \[
  Gal \cong \left(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}\right)^\times
  \]
  that is a \nameref{def:cyclicgroup} of order 4. It is generated by
  $\zeta_5 \to \zeta_5^2$ and it has only one
  \nameref{def:propersubgroup} $\cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ so our
  field $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right)$
  has only one sub-field different from $\mathbb{Q}$ of course and
  this going to be a real part all of the complex conjugation which
  are part of Galois group. Now this is the same as the real part
  $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5\right) \cap \mathbb{R} =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_5 + \bar{\zeta}_5\right) =
  \mathbb{Q}\left(cos \frac{2 \pi}{5}\right)$.
\end{example}
So these were the examples of cyclotomic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$
and of course the picture is exactly the same as long as the
cyclotomic polynomial is irreducible. If it is not reducible, which
can happen as we have seen, the Galois group becomes smaller.

\section{Kummer extensions}

Consider a field $K$ such that the characteristics of $K$ is prime to
a certain number $n$: $\left(char K, n\right) = 1$ and such that $X^n
- 1$ splits in $K$. So $K$ contains all roots of unity. Consider an
element $a$ of $K$ : $a \in K$ and let $\alpha = \sqrt[n]{a}$ (i.e. a
root of $X^n - a$). Take $d = \min{\left\{ i \mid \alpha^i \in
  K\right\}}$.

\begin{proposition}
  $d \mid n$, minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ is $X^d - \alpha^d$ and
  $K\left(\alpha\right)$ is a \nameref{def:galoisextension} with
  cyclic \nameref{def:galoisgroup} of order $d$.
  \begin{proof}
    It's clear that $K\left(\alpha\right)$ is Galois because all the
    n-th roots of unity are in $K$. So $K\left(\alpha\right)$
    contains all roots of $X^n - a$. Therefore $K\left(\alpha\right)$
    is a \nameref{def:splittingfield} of $X^n - a$. So it's normal and
    separable because it is a separable polynomial because $\left(char
    K, n\right) = 1$.

    Lets define a \nameref{def:homomorphism}
    $f: Gal\left(K\left(\alpha\right)/K\right) \xrightarrow[g \to
      \frac{g\left(\alpha\right)}{\alpha}]{} \mu_n$. This is correct
    because $g$ sends $\alpha$ to another root of $X^n - a$ thus the
    quotient $\frac{g\left(\alpha\right)}{\alpha}$ is a root of unity:
    \[
    \left(\frac{g\left(\alpha\right)}{\alpha}\right)^n = 1.
    \]
    The homomorphism $f$ is \nameref{def:injection} because
    $g\left(\alpha\right)$ determines $g$. What's the image? It should
    be a \nameref{def:subgroup} of a \nameref{def:cyclicgroup} $\mu_n$
    but the subgroup should be also cyclic.
    \footnote{
      ??? add a ref
    }
    Let $\delta$ is the order of the image and we want to show that
    $\delta = d$. Consider
    $g\left(\alpha^\delta\right) = f\left(g\right)^\delta \cdot
    \alpha^\delta = \alpha^\delta$ because $f\left(g\right)$ is a root
    of 1 ($f\left(g\right) = \sqrt[\delta]{1}$). Thus $\alpha^\delta
    \in K$. And $\alpha^i \notin K$ for $i < \delta$ since otherwise
    $\deg P_{min}\left(\alpha, K\right) = i < \delta$. But this is
    impossible because
    \[
    \left[K\left(\alpha\right):K\right] =
    \left|Gal\left(K\left(\alpha\right)/K\right)\right| = \delta.
    \]
    Thus only possible option is $d = \delta$. Thus
    $P_{min}\left(\alpha, K\right) = X^d - \alpha^d$.
  \end{proof}
  \label{prop:lec7_1}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  And conversely (to \ref{prop:lec7_1}) for all cyclic extension of
  degree $n$ such that $\left(char K, n\right) = 1$ is generated by
  $\sqrt[n]{a}$ for some $a \in K$.
  \begin{proof}
    Consider $L$ is an extension of $K$.
    $Gal\left(L/K\right) = \left<\sigma\right>$ then we have
    $\sigma^n = id$. We have that $\sigma$ is diagonalisable.
    \footnote{
      ??? add a ref to linear algebra theorem
    }
    Now, let us show that all eigenspaces have dimension 1. Indeed if
    $x,y$ are in the same eigenspace then
    $\sigma\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \frac{x}{y}$ because $x$ and $y$
    are multiplied by the same number. Therefore $\frac{x}{y} \in
    K$. And this is exactly means that dimension of the eigenspace is
    1.
    \footnote{
      ???
    }
    Thus all roots of 1 are eigenvalues of $\sigma$. Then take
    $\alpha$ such that $\sigma\left(\alpha\right) = \zeta \alpha$
    where $\zeta$ is a \nameref{def:primitiverootsofunity}. Then
    $\left<\sigma\right>$ - orbit of $\alpha$ has $n$ elements
    therefore $\left[K\left(\alpha\right):K\right] = n$ (see
    explanation below) and $\alpha^n
    \in K$ since $\sigma\left(\alpha^n\right) = \zeta^n \cdot \alpha^n
    = \alpha^n$. We see that $\alpha$ is a root of $X^n - a$. This is
    irreducible by degree reason.

    Maybe I should have said here, why it follows from the formula,
    $\left<\sigma\right>$ - orbit of $\alpha$ has $n$ elements
    that the degree of the extension is exactly $n$. While this is
    easy because either degree of the extension was less than $n$,
    then also, alpha would have to be fixed by some non-trivial
    subgroup of Galois group by Galois correspondence. And then its
    orbit would have less than $n$ elements.  
  \end{proof}
  \label{prop:lec7_2}
\end{proposition}
  
\section{Artin-Schreier extensions}
Let $n = char K$ this is called as Artin-Schreier extensions.

\begin{definition}[Cyclic extension]
  The Galois extension is called cyclic extension if the corresponding
  \nameref{def:galoisgroup} is cyclic.
  \label{def:cyclicextension}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $p - char K$ and let
  $P = X^p - X - a \in K\left[X\right]$. Then $P$ is irreducible or
  splits over $K$. Let $\alpha$ be a root. If $P$ is irreducible the
  $K\left(\alpha\right)$ is \nameref{def:cyclicextension} of $K$ of
  degree $p$.

  Conversely any cyclic extension of degree $p$ is like this: $L/K,
  \exists \alpha \in K$ such that $L = K\left(\alpha\right)$, $\alpha$
  - root of $X^p - X - a$ for some $a \in K$.
  \begin{proof}
    First of all notice that roots of $P$ are $\alpha + k$ where $k
    \in \mathbb{F}_p$ ($k$ is an element of prime field).

    If $P$ is irreducible then \nameref{def:galoisgroup} should be
    transitive on the roots (??? see theorem \ref{thm:lec5_3})  then
    $\exists \sigma \in Gal\left(K\left(\alpha\right)/K\right)$ such that
    $\sigma\left(\alpha\right) = \alpha + 1$ (because roots of $P$ are
    $\alpha + k$). The \nameref{def:grouporder} for $\sigma$ is
    $p = \left[K\left(\alpha\right):K\right]$ so the $\sigma$ must
    generate the \nameref{def:galoisgroup}:
    $Gal\left(K\left(\alpha\right)/K\right) = \left<\sigma\right>$.

    We have to show that if $P$ is not irreducible then $P$ splits
    i.e. $\alpha \in K$. Leave it for an exercise
    \footnote{
      ??? proof
    }

    Now we will prove the converse statement. Let $L$ is a
    \nameref{def:cyclicextension} of $K$ of degree $p$. We want to
    find $\alpha$ such that $\sigma\left(\alpha\right) = \alpha + 1$
    where $\sigma$ is a generator of $Gal\left(L/K\right)$ (we know
    that the Galois group is cyclic i.e. must have the following form
    $Gal\left(L/K\right) = \left<\sigma\right>$).

    Set $f = \sigma -id$, $K = \ker f$
    \footnote{
      this is because
      $\forall x \in K: \sigma\left(x\right) = x$ (see
      (\ref{eq:lec5_2})).
    }
    and the \nameref{def:rank} $rg f = p -1$
    \footnote{
      ??? in lectures we can hear about range (\nameref{def:image}) not a
      \nameref{def:rank} but by future content we spoke about the rank
      but not about range (image)
    }
    $\left(\sigma - id\right)^p = 0$ so the \nameref{def:kernel} must
    be included into \nameref{def:image}: $K = \ker f \subset \Ima f$
    because otherwise $L = \ker f \oplus \Ima f$ ($L$ is a
    \nameref{def:directsum} of 
    kernel and image) and $f^k$ is never zero (but we have $f^p = 0$)
    \footnote{
      ??? needs a proof or a ref
    }.

    So as soon as $K$ is an image of $f$ then $\exists \alpha \in L$
    such that $f\left(\alpha\right) = 1$ but this means that
    $\sigma\left(\alpha\right) = \alpha + 1$. Now consider
    $\sigma\left(\alpha^p - \alpha\right) =
    \left(\alpha + 1\right)^p - \left(\alpha + 1\right) = \alpha^p -
    \alpha$ (because we are in the field of characteristic $p$). This
    means that $\alpha^p - \alpha \in K$ because the field is fixed by
    Galois group (see (\ref{eq:lec5_2})). So
    $\alpha^p - \alpha =  a \in K$ and $\alpha$ is a root of $X^p - X
    - a$ and this finished the proof of the theorem.
  \end{proof}
  \label{thm:lec7_1}
\end{theorem}

\section{Composite extensions. Properties}

\begin{definition}[Composite extension]
  Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ are extensions of $K$ both contained in some
  extension $L$ (for instance the \nameref{def:algebraicclosure}
  $\bar{K}$). The composite extension $L_1 L_2$ is the extension they
  generate: $L_1 L_2 = L_2 L_1 = K\left(L_1 \cup L_2\right)$.
  \label{def:compositeextension}
\end{definition}

Another way to view this: consider the tensor product $L_1 \otimes_K
L_2$ - there is a $K$-algebra. By \nameref{def:universalproperty}
there is a map from the tensor product to $L$:
\[
j: L_1 \otimes_K L_2 \to L  
\]
such that $j\left(l_1 \otimes l_2\right) = l_1 l_2$ (??? can be considered
as a bilinear map required for the universal property). The
\nameref{def:image} $\Ima j$ is a sub-algebra of $L$. If $L$ is
algebraic then any sub algebra is a sub field (??? add a ref) and this
is exactly the field generated by $L_1 L_2$. In general we can take
its fraction field (to obtain a field from a ring (an algebra)).

\begin{property}
  If $L_1$ is separable (pure inseparable, normal, finite of
  degree $n$) over $K$ then $L_1 L_2$ is also separable (pure
  inseparable, normal, finite of degree $ \le n$) over $L_2$
  \begin{proof}
    Let $x \in L_1 L_2$ ($L_1 L_2$ is generated by $L_1$ over $L_2$)
    then it's minimal polynomial $P_{min}\left(x, L_2\right)$ is a
    divisor of $P_{min}\left(x, K\right)$ in
    $L_2\left[X\right]$. Therefore $P_{min}\left(x, L_2\right)$ has a
    degree $\le n$ where $n$ 
    is degree of $P_{min}\left(x, K\right)$.

    So if $P_{min}\left(x, K\right)$ is separable (pure inseparable,
    normal, finite of degree $n$)  then $P_{min}\left(x, L_2\right)$
    is separable (pure inseparable, normal, finite of degree $\le n$).

    The same is true for splitting so the normality is preserved.

    About dimensions (``finite extension of degree'' in the property
    formulation). By the \nameref{thm:basechange}:
    \[
    \dim_K L_1 = \dim_{L_2}\left(L_1 \otimes_K L_2\right)
    \]
    and as soon as $L_1 L_2$ is the $\Ima j$:
    \[
    \dim_{L_2}\left(L_1 \otimes_K L_2\right) \ge
    \dim_{L_2}\left(L_1 L_2\right)
    \]
    i.e.
    \[
    \dim_{L_2}\left(L_1 L_2\right) \le \dim_K L_1 = n.
    \]
  \end{proof}
  \label{property:lec7_1}
\end{property}

\begin{property}
  If $L_1, L_2$ are separable (pure inseparable, normal, finite of
  degree $n$ and $m$) over $K$ then $L_1 L_2$ is also separable (pure
  inseparable, normal, finite of degree $ \le n m $) over $K$
  \begin{proof}
    We have the following towers:
    \[
    K \hookrightarrow L_1 \hookrightarrow L_1 L_2
    \]
    and all properties except normality are preserved in the towers so
    follows from property \ref{property:lec7_1}.

    Normality is obvious because if $L_1$ is a splitting field of the
    family polynomials $\left\{P_i\right\}_{i \in I}$
    and $L_2$ is a splitting field of the
    family polynomials $\left\{Q_j\right\}_{j \in J}$ then
    $L_1 L_2$ is a splitting field of the union of those families
    $\left\{P_i, Q_j\right\}_{i \in I, j \in J}$. So normality is
    obviously preserved.  
  \end{proof}
  \label{property:lec7_2}
\end{property}


\section{Linearly disjoint extensions. Examples}

\begin{theorem}
  The following statements are equivalent (for algebraic extensions)
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $L_1 \otimes_k L_2$ is a field \label{thm:lec7_2_a}
  \item $j$ is \nameref{def:injection} \label{thm:lec7_2_b}
  \item if we have $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \in L_1$ linearly independent
    over $K$ then they are linearly independent
    over $L_2$ \label{thm:lec7_2_c}
  \item if we have two families: $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \in L_1$ linearly independent
    over $K$ and  $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m \in L_2$ linearly independent
    over $K$ then $x_i y_j$ linearly independent over $K$
    \label{thm:lec7_2_d}
  \end{enumerate}
  When $L_1$ finite over $K$ then all the statements are equivalent to
  $\left[L_1 L_2 : L_2\right] = \left[L_1 : K\right]$ or in other
  words
  $\left[L_1 L_2 : K\right] = \left[L_1 : K\right] \left[L_2 :
    K\right]$
  \begin{definition}[Linearly disjoint extensions]
    In the case $L_1$ and $L_2$ are called linearly disjoint extensions
    \label{def:linearlydisjoint}
  \end{definition}
  \begin{proof}
    Equivalence \ref{thm:lec7_2_a} and \ref{thm:lec7_2_b} is clear
    because we have that $L_1 L_2 = \Ima j$.

    Then \ref{thm:lec7_2_b} implies \ref{thm:lec7_2_c}: we have
    $x_1 \otimes 1, \dots, x_n \otimes 1$ are linearly independent
    over $L_2$ by \nameref{thm:basechange} property (??? is the link
    correct). If $j$ is injective then their images $x_1, \dots, x_n$
    are also linearly independent over $L_2$. This is because an
    injective map transforms a linearly independent set of vectors
    into a linearly independent set.

    \ref{thm:lec7_2_c} implies \ref{thm:lec7_2_d}: if we have some
    relation $\sum a_{ij} x_i y_j = 0, a_{ij} \in K$ then since $x_i$
    linearly independent over $K$ one can get $\sum a_{ij} y_j = 0$
    but as soon as $y_j$ linearly independent we will get $a_{ij} =
    0$.

    Next \ref{thm:lec7_2_d} implies \ref{thm:lec7_2_b} (remember that
    \ref{thm:lec7_2_b} is injectivity of $j$). Take
    $z \in L_1 \otimes_K L_2$ such that $j\left(z\right) = 0$. We have
    $z = \sum a_{ij} x_i \otimes y_j$ and
    $j\left(z\right) = \sum a_{ij} x_i y_j = 0$ i.e. $a_{ij} = 0$ and
    therefore $z = 0$. I.e. $j$ is \nameref{def:injection}.

    The part about finite degrees follows from the 4 properties (???
    need a proof)
  \end{proof}
  \label{thm:lec7_2}
\end{theorem}
